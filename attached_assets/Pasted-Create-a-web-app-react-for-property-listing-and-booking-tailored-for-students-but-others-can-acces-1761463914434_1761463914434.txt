Create a web app (react) for property listing and booking tailored for students but others can access it as well. Let the app be robust in design and in content. Do not use placeholder code at all. About Us :We specialize in connecting students with safe, affordable off-campus housing through an easy-to-use website. Our platform helps property owners showcase their homes and rooms directly to students searching for convenient places to live near the University. By simplifying the booking process and providing reliable house listing, we aim to make student housing stress-free for both renters and landlords. Our goal is to create a trusted community where students find great homes and property owners enjoy steady bookings and transparent communicationâ€”all in one place. We are currently domicilled in Jos Plateau State and are closer to unijos but all schools in Plateau State are welcome. Registration is done with full name and email, random usernames are given for every user, every user can change their usernames only once, the first two users to change their user names to "mantim" and "henry" will be assigned the super_admin role upon updating of the names. Admin will manage the entire app including user, properties, pricing, images, featured management, etc. we will use blob for images but urls will be used for supabase, so any image uploaded to blob will have their urls put in supabase. Search online for professional, clean, divine, powerful, sleek and dynamic design! Search online for Professional similar apps and learn from them so that the app will not be scanty and boring. There will be need for one to upload a photo of their NIN slip or any of the listed forms of identification( voters card, drivers license, international passport, or student ID card) before users can book. The booking process is per year only, there is possibility for delay before paying so there will be two buttons at the bottom of the booking form, one saying pay now, then the other one saying book the one with book has two options, when clicked a dropdown saying 24 hours and 48 hours. The admin can set prices for the delayed payments. Admin will approve ID verification. Upon opening the app before authenticated, the / page will be shown first which will not be a landing page but a quasi dashboard that exist just for temporary display of the sites resources for attractiveness and promotion. There will be a get started button by the top right for unauthenticated users, after users authenticate, the username will be displayed in the button. If user doesn't pay within time of booking, it will be cancelled. number of rooms, type of building, locations will be featured, search option for required needs, results can be precise or the closest. Once paid and confirmed, receipt with details and transaction reference can be downloaded by user, receipt will include details such as time frame for house tenancy as well as transaction reference. Every property will have a short ID. Admins will upload homes, prices and amenities, locations, etc colors are: orange, green and blue, the app will have dark background. we will use paystack(secret and public key) for payment. Make sure you give proper margins in the app, both for mobile and web. I want proper documentation and management ! both for users and properties, everything should be neat and detailed.
